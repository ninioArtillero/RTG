# TODO list

* [x] Asynchronous evaluation of patterns.
* [ ] Homogenize rhythmic pattern types show function. Each type should be tagged appropriately.
* [ ] Scheduling options for event streams: homogeneous using the binary representation (congruent with the rhythmic pattern abstraction) or heterogeneous using a rationals (to avoid sending _silence_ messages).
* [ ] Implement pattern sync.
* [ ] Make patterns addressable so they can be stoped (global state?).
* [ ] A switch to make new scheduled patterns affect current playing patterns.
* [ ] Implement well-formed rhythms (Â¿3 parameters?)
* [ ] Continuous morphing of well-formed rhythms using ratio parameter.
* [ ] Have signals for parameter control (for morphing).
* [ ] Geometrically informed continuous morphing between two arbitrary rhythms

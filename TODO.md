# TODO list

* [x] Asynchronous evaluation of patterns.
* [ ] Homogenize rhythmic pattern types show function. Each type should be tagged appropriately.
* [ ] Scheduling options for event streams: homogeneous using the binary representation (congruent with the rhythmic pattern abstraction) or heterogeneous using a rationals (to avoid sending _silence_ messages).
* [ ] Implement pattern sync.
* [ ] Make patterns addressable so they can be stoped (global state?).

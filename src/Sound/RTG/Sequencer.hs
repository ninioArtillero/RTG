-- Module      : Sequencer
-- Description : A sequencer using the Timed IO Monad.
-- Copyright   : (c) Xavier GÃ³ngora, 2025

-- Maintainer  : ixbalanque@protonmail.ch
-- Stability   : experimental
--
-- The execution model of the sequencer follows the form of a /fiber bundle/,
-- where the 'PatternPool' is the /bundle/, the 'SequencerPattern'
-- is the /fiber/, and the 'globalPattern' the /base space/.
-- So that transformations on the bundle are projected into base, which
-- is the pattern to be executed.
--
-- Some sections of this module are (very) unsafe due to the use of 'Foreign.Store',
-- whose documentation is rather opaque about its implementation quirks.
-- Modify with care, as a 'Store' is not thread safe and its values not typechecked,
-- which can easily make the process blow up.

-- correct timing.

-- The playback is in a loop and runs on a forked thread.
-- This functions is called at 'refreshSequencerPattern'
-- to play the current 'globalPattern'.
-- There the 'Micro' parameter corresponds to the duration of each event,
-- and is derived from the global cps value and the pattern length.
